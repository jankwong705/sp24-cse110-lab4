- Asychronous nature can lead to difficulty in tracing code when debugging because, unlike the usual programming languages which force code to execute line by line, the asychronous nature makes the order of execution less obvious. It could be messy or hard to trace if we have a lot of code.
- Loose typing can prone developers and users to errors or bugs, which cause the program to behave not in the way desired, causing confusions or inconveniences to users. For example, in the debugging example presented in this lab earlier, because of JavaScript's loose typing, instead of actually adding the numbers, a concatenation is performed, which is opposite of what is expected.
- Running on different web platforms might cause compatibility issues. It might result in a lot of tedious maintenance. 
2. The creaters of JavaScript made it loosely typed potentially in order to reduce the presence of errors and to increase its versatility. Because inputs from users can vary a lot, making JavaScript loosely typed can not only make it more versatile, but also reduce the presence of errors by giving users "some input" instead of some uninterpretable errors. They made it asynchronous potentially because to make websites faster. If a website is slow and sluggish because the program has to wait for a certain line to finish, it will result in poor user experience. Therefore, making JavaScript asynchronous can potentially increase performance and efficiency.
